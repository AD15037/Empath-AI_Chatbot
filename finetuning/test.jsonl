I couldn’t breathe, and I felt like I was going to die."},{"role": "assistant", "content": "That sounds terrifying. During these moments, are you able to remind yourself that it’s a panic attack and not something life-threatening?"},{"role": "user", "content": "Sometimes I try, but it feels so real that I can’t think clearly."},{"role": "assistant", "content": "That’s completely understandable. Panic attacks can overwhelm our ability to think logically. One technique that can help is grounding yourself in the present. For example, try focusing on your breathing and counting to four as you inhale and exhale. Would you like to practice that now?"},{"role": "user", "content": "Okay, let’s try."},{"role": "assistant", "content": "Great. Take a deep breath in… one, two, three, four. Hold it for a moment. Now exhale slowly… one, two, three, four. How does that feel?"},{"role": "user", "content": "It feels calming, actually."},{"role": "assistant", "content": "That’s good to hear. The next time you feel a panic attack coming on, try this exercise. Let’s also discuss a longer-term plan to identify triggers and build resilience."}]}

Have you tried journaling before bed to get those thoughts out of your head?"},{"role": "user", "content": "No, I haven’t. Would that really help?"},{"role": "assistant", "content": "It can. Writing your thoughts down can create a sense of release, making it easier to relax. Let’s also discuss some calming bedtime routines, like deep breathing or listening to soothing music, to prepare your mind for sleep."},{"role": "user", "content": "Okay, I’ll try that."},{"role": "assistant", "content": "Great.

Would you like to try that?"},{"role": "user", "content": "A letter? I’m not sure what I’d write."},{"role": "assistant", "content": "You can start by telling him how you’re feeling and what you’d want to say if he were here. It doesn’t have to be perfect—just whatever comes to mind."},{"role": "user", "content": "That sounds like it could help. I’ll try it."},{"role": "assistant", "content": "Good.

What usually happens during these arguments?"},{"role": "user", "content": "I try to explain my feelings, but they interrupt or get defensive."},{"role": "assistant", "content": "It sounds like the conversations escalate quickly. Have you considered using ‘I’ statements to express how you feel without placing blame?"},{"role": "user", "content": "I’m not sure how to do that."},{"role": "assistant", "content": "For example, instead of saying, ‘You never listen to me,’ you could say, ‘I feel hurt when I don’t feel heard.’ This shifts the focus to your emotions rather than their actions."},{"role": "user", "content": "That makes sense.

It just feels like this cloud that never goes away."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I hear you. Let’s start small—what’s one thing you’d like to accomplish tomorrow, even if it’s tiny?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "I guess I could try to take a shower in the morning."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "That’s a great step. When you accomplish that, take a moment to acknowledge it—it’s progress. Over time, small wins like these build momentum. How do you feel about us checking in on this next session?"}]}

When they happen, how do you usually respond?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "I just freeze. It feels like I’m back in that moment all over again."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Freezing is a common response. Let’s work on a grounding technique to help you reconnect with the present when that happens. For instance, try naming five things you can see, four you can touch, three you can hear, two you can smell, and one you can taste."}, {"role": "user", "content": "I’ve never tried that before."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let’s practice it now so you feel more prepared.

Now, let’s move on to touch—what can you feel right now?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "My sweater. It’s soft."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Great.

We were together for so long, and now I don’t know who I am without them."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "That’s a very natural feeling after a breakup. It’s a big transition. Have you been able to think about things you used to enjoy before the relationship?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Not really. I can’t seem to focus on anything."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It’s okay to feel that way. Healing takes time. Let’s try this: write down one activity you enjoyed before the relationship. Then, sometime this week, set aside 15 minutes to do it. How does that sound?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "I used to enjoy painting. I could try that."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "That’s a wonderful idea. Painting might help you reconnect with yourself. Let’s check in next session to see how it felt."}]}

What thoughts were running through your mind at the time?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "I kept thinking I was saying the wrong things or that people didn’t want me there."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Those thoughts can feel so real in the moment. Let’s challenge them—what evidence do you have that people were judging you?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "I guess none, really. No one said anything."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "That’s an important realization. What if you focused on the idea that people were just happy to see you? Would that change how you felt?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Maybe."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let’s practice shifting your focus next time you’re in a social setting.

What’s one small boundary you could set this week?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Maybe I could stop checking emails after 7 p.m."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "That’s a great start.

When they occur, do you have any strategies to ground yourself in the present?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Not really. I just try to wait it out."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let’s work on grounding techniques. For example, you can describe your surroundings out loud—what you see, hear, and feel. Would you like to practice that now?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Sure. I see my couch, I hear the clock ticking, and I feel the cushion under my hand."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Excellent. These small observations remind your brain that you’re in the present.

Let’s explore this belief—what evidence supports it, and what evidence challenges it?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "I guess the evidence is that I do make mistakes, but I can’t control everything."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Exactly. It’s important to recognize the difference between taking responsibility and taking on blame that isn’t yours. How would it feel to remind yourself, 'I’m doing my best, and that’s enough'?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "It feels strange, but maybe it could help."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It takes practice, but it can shift how you view yourself.

Let’s build on that—what kind of music makes you feel the most alive?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Probably upbeat songs."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "That’s a great start.

I try to stay busy, but it’s like there’s a hole in me that I can’t fill."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It’s common to feel that emptiness after a loss. Are there any activities or people that make you feel a little better, even if just for a moment?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "I’ve tried talking to friends, but sometimes I feel like they don’t understand. I used to enjoy painting, but now it feels pointless."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It sounds like you’re grieving not just the relationship, but the part of you that enjoyed those activities.

Let’s explore some strategies to help you manage those moments when you feel that anger rising."}, {"role": "user", "content": "I feel like it builds up, and then it just erupts. I don’t even know how to stop it."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It’s good that you’re recognizing this pattern. One thing we can try is identifying the early signs of anger, so you can catch it before it builds up.

It’s like I can’t control it."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Those are great signals to pay attention to.

I’ve done it before, and I can’t stop thinking about it."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It’s normal to feel anxious about social interactions, especially when we’ve had negative experiences in the past.

I don’t want to keep shutting people out, but I don’t know how to react."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It’s okay to feel overwhelmed, but there are techniques we can try.
